Desktop application of the Szondi test. The user can select the 2 most sympathetic and the two less images of each of the six series. Then the program moves to the second stage (for the "experimental backgroupd plan") presenting the remaining 4 images for each serie. At the end displays, and copies to the clipboard, the configuration of each of the four vectors (S, P, Sch, C), for both the foreground plan and the experimental background plan, like this: S(h+/-, s+) P(e-, hy0) Sch(k+!!, p-) C(d-, m!+/-),

Future version may be ported to browser platform (possibly silverlight). Project developed with sharpdevelop (.net/winforms/c#).
